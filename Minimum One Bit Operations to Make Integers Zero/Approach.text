Approach:
1. Initialize variables 'multiplier' and 'res' to keep track of the sign of the operation and the result.
   - 'multiplier': Alternates between 1 and -1 to control the sign of the operation.
   - 'res': Accumulates the total minimum one-bit operations.
2. Iterate while 'n' is greater than 0.
   a. Update 'res' by performing bitwise XOR between 'n' and the previous value of 'n' multiplied by 'multiplier.'
   b. Toggle the sign of 'multiplier' by multiplying it by -1.
   c. Update 'n' by performing bitwise AND between 'n' and 'n - 1' (turning off the rightmost set bit).
3. Return the absolute value of 'res' as the result.

Time Complexity:
- O(log N), where 'N' is the value of 'n.' The algorithm iterates through the bits of 'n' in the worst case.

Space Complexity:
- O(1) as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space. The variables 'multiplier' and 'res' are independent of the input size.
