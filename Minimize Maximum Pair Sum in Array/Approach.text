Approach:
- Sort the array 'nums' in ascending order using Arrays.sort(nums).
- Initialize a variable 'minMaxSum' to store the minimum maximum pair sum.
- Iterate through the first half of the sorted array (up to 'nums.length / 2').
   - For each pair of elements at indices 'i' and 'nums.length - 1 - i,' calculate the sum.
   - Update 'minMaxSum' with the maximum of its current value and the calculated sum.
- Return the final 'minMaxSum' as the result.

Time Complexity:
- O(n log n), where 'n' is the length of the array. The dominant factor is the sorting operation.

Space Complexity:
- O(1) as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space.
