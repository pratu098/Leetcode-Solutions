Approach:
- Initialize a constant 'mod' as 1000000007.
- Iterate through the array 'nums' and transform each element by subtracting its reverse using the 'reverse' function.
- Sort the modified array 'nums.'
- Initialize a variable 'res' to store the count of nice pairs.
- Iterate through the sorted array and count the number of consecutive equal elements, calculating the number of pairs for each group.
- Update 'res' with the sum of pairs for each group.
- Return the final count of nice pairs.

Time Complexity:
- O(N log N), where 'N' is the length of the array. The dominant factor is the sorting operation.

Space Complexity:
- O(1) as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space. The size of the array 'nums' is modified in-place, and the extra space used is not dependent on the input size.
