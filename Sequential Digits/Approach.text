Approach:

Sequential Digit Generation:
   - Initialize an empty list `a` to store sequential digits.
   - Iterate through digits from 1 to 9 (inclusive).
   - For each starting digit, generate sequential digits by adding the next digit until reaching 9.
   - Add each generated number to the list `a` if it is within the given range `[low, high]`.
   - Sort the list `a` in ascending order.

Time Complexity:
   - The time complexity is O(1) since the number of iterations is constant (9 iterations).

Space Complexity:
   - The space complexity is O(1) as no additional data structures are used.
