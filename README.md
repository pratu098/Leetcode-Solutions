### ðŸŽ“ Opening Poem

```plaintext
In ancient times, there were the eight-legged essay exams,
Today, we have LeetCode challenges.
The former demanded structured format and eloquence,
The latter requires problem-solving skills and memorization.
They share the same philosophy: "Practice makes perfect."
Why, you may ask, is today not like the past?
It's not a decline, but rather a shift.
The ancient exams sought talents for the nation,
LeetCode sifts through code for Google's needs.
Each era has its own demands.
```
