Approach:

1. Depth-First Search (DFS):
   - Implement a recursive DFS function that returns an array containing the minimum and maximum values in the subtree rooted at the current node.
   - Initialize the maximum absolute difference variable `m` to 0.
   - In each recursive call, compute the minimum and maximum values in the current subtree and update `m` with the maximum absolute difference between the current node's value and the minimum/maximum values in the subtree.
   - Return the array containing the minimum and maximum values.

2. Main Function:
   - Start the DFS from the root node, passing the maximum absolute difference variable `m` by reference.
   - The result of the DFS function will be the minimum and maximum values in the entire tree rooted at the current node.
   - Update `m` with the maximum absolute difference encountered during the traversal.
   - Finally, return the maximum absolute difference (`m`).

3. Time Complexity:
   - The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once during the DFS traversal.

4. Space Complexity:
   - The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This is the maximum depth of the recursive call stack.
