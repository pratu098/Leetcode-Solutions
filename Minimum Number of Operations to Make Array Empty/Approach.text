Approach:

1. Initialize HashMap:
   - Create a `HashMap` named `mp` to store the frequency of each element in the `nums` array.

2. Count Frequency:
   - Iterate through the `nums` array and count the frequency of each element.
   - Use the `put` method to update the count in the map.

3. Initialize Operation Count:
   - Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the minimum operations needed.

4. Iterate through HashMap Entries:
   - Iterate through the entries in the `mp` HashMap using a for-each loop.

5. Calculate Operations:
   - For each entry, get the frequency count (`t`) of the current element.
   - If the frequency is 1, return -1 as it is not possible to make a single element divisible by 3.

6. Calculate Count:
   - Calculate the number of operations needed to make the frequency divisible by 3.
   - Count the complete sets of 3 elements (`t / 3`) and increment the count for any remaining elements (`t % 3 != 0`).

7. Return Result:
   - Return the total count of operations needed.

Time Complexity:
   - The time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the `nums` array. The algorithm iterates through the array once.

Space Complexity:
   - The space complexity is O(U), where U is the number of unique elements in the `nums` array. The algorithm uses a HashMap to store the frequency of each unique element.
