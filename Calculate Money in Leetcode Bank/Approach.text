Approach:
1. Initialize a variable 'total' to 0 to represent the total amount of money.
2. Iterate through each day from 0 to 'n-1.'
3. Calculate the amount of money earned on the current day using the formula '(day / 7 + 1) + (day % 7).' 
   - '(day / 7 + 1)' represents the full weeks, and '(day % 7)' represents the additional days within the current week.
4. Add the calculated amount to 'total.'
5. After the loop, 'total' will contain the total amount of money earned.
6. Return 'total' as the result.

Explanation:
The goal is to calculate the total amount of money earned over 'n' days based on a daily earning pattern. The algorithm iterates through each day and calculates the daily earnings using the given formula.

Time Complexity:
- O(N), where 'N' is the input 'n.' The algorithm iterates through each day in the loop.

Space Complexity:
- O(1) as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space. The variable 'total' is independent of the input size.
