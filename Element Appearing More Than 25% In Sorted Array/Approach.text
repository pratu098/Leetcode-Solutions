Approach:
1. Initialize variables 'size' to store the length of the input array 'arr', 'qtr' to store one-fourth of the size, 'cnt' to track the current count of consecutive identical elements, and 'p' to store the previous element.
2. Iterate through the array 'arr' starting from index 1.
3. For each element, check if it is equal to the previous element 'p':
   - If equal, increment the count 'cnt'.
   - If not equal, reset the count 'cnt' to 1.
4. Check if the count 'cnt' is greater than one-fourth of the size 'qtr':
   - If true, return the current element as it is the special integer.
5. Update the previous element 'p' with the current element.
6. If no special integer is found during the iteration, return the last element as the special integer.

Explanation:
The algorithm finds the special integer in the array by iterating through the elements and maintaining a count of consecutive identical elements. It returns the element that appears more than one-fourth of the array size.

Time Complexity:
- O(N), where 'N' is the size of the input array 'arr.' The algorithm iterates through each element once.

Space Complexity:
- O(1) as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space. The variables 'size,' 'qtr,' 'cnt,' and 'p' are independent of the input size.
