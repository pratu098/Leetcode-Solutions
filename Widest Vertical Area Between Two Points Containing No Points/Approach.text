Approach:

1. Sort Points Based on x-coordinate:
   - Sort the points array based on the x-coordinates of the points. This ensures that adjacent points have their x-coordinates in ascending order.

2. Calculate Maximum Width:
   - Iterate through the sorted points array.
   - For each pair of adjacent points, calculate the width as the difference between their x-coordinates (`width = points[i][0] - points[i - 1][0]`).
   - Update the `max_width` with the maximum calculated width.

3. Return Maximum Width:
   - After iterating through all pairs of adjacent points, return the `max_width`.

Explanation:

The algorithm sorts the points array based on the x-coordinates of the points. Then, it iterates through the sorted array, calculating the width between adjacent points and updating the maximum width. Finally, it returns the maximum width.

Time Complexity:
- The sorting step takes O(N log N) time, where N is the number of points.
- The iteration through the sorted array takes O(N) time.
- The overall time complexity is O(N log N).

Space Complexity:
- The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space (for variables), resulting in a space complexity of O(1).
