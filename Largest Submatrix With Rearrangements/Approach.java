Approach:
- Iterate through each row of the matrix starting from the second row (index 1).
- For each element in the current row, update its value to the sum of the corresponding element in the previous row if the current element is 1.
- Iterate through each row of the matrix.
   a. Sort the row in ascending order.
   b. For each column, calculate the area of the largest submatrix ending at the current element by multiplying its height with the column index.
   c. Update the maximum area if the calculated area is larger than the current maximum.
- Return the maximum area as the result.

Time Complexity:
- O(M * N * log N), where 'M' is the number of rows and 'N' is the number of columns. The algorithm iterates through each element in the matrix and sorts each row.

Space Complexity:
- O(1) as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space. The sorting is done in-place, and the only additional variables used are 'maxi' and loop iterators.
