Approach:

Stack for Evaluation:
   - Use a stack to perform the evaluation of the given Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) expression.
   - Iterate through each token in the expression.
   - If the token is an operand, push it onto the stack.
   - If the token is an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), pop the required number of operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.
   - The final result will be the only element left in the stack.

Time Complexity:
   - The time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of tokens in the expression.
   - Each token is processed once.

Space Complexity:
   - The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of operands in the expression.
   - The stack stores the operands during the evaluation.
