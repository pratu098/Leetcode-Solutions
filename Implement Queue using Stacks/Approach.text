Approach:

1. Two Stacks:
   - Use two stacks (`s1` and `s2`) to simulate the queue.
   - For the `push` operation:
      - Move all elements from `s1` to `s2`.
      - Push the new element onto `s1`.
      - Move all elements from `s2` back to `s1`.
   - For the `pop` operation:
      - Pop the top element from `s1`.
   - For the `peek` operation:
      - Return the top element of `s1` without popping it.
   - For the `empty` operation:
      - Check if `s1` is empty.

Time Complexity
   - The `push` operation takes O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the queue at that point.
   - The `pop`, `peek`, and `empty` operations take O(1) time.

Space Complexity:
   - The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the queue. This is because both stacks may contain all elements of the queue.
