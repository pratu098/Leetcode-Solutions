Approach:

1. Data Structures:
   - Use an `ArrayList<Integer>` to store the elements of the set.
   - Use a `HashMap<Integer, Integer>` to store the mapping of each element to its index in the `ArrayList`.

2. Operations:
   - Insert Operation (`insert`):
     - Check if the element exists in the `HashMap` using `map.containsKey(val)`.
     - If the element exists, return `false` as it's already in the set.
     - Otherwise, add the element to the end of the `ArrayList` and update its index in the `HashMap`.
     - Return `true` to indicate a successful insertion.

   - Remove Operation (`remove`):
     - Check if the element exists in the `HashMap` using `map.containsKey(val)`.
     - If the element doesn't exist, return `false` as it's not in the set.
     - Get the index of the element from the `HashMap`.
     - Replace the element at the index with the last element of the `ArrayList`.
     - Update the index of the moved element in the `HashMap`.
     - Remove the last element from the `ArrayList` and remove the element's entry from the `HashMap`.
     - Return `true` to indicate a successful removal.

   - Search Operation (`search`):
     - Check if the element exists in the `HashMap` using `map.containsKey(val)`.
     - Return `true` if the element is found, and `false` otherwise.

   - Get Random Element (`getRandom`):
     - Use `Random` to generate a random index within the size of the `ArrayList`.
     - Return the element at the randomly generated index.

3. Time Complexity:
   - The average time complexity for insert, remove, and getRandom operations is O(1), as they involve constant-time operations on the `ArrayList` and `HashMap`.

4. Space Complexity:
   - The space complexity is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the set. This accounts for the space used by the `ArrayList` and `HashMap`.
