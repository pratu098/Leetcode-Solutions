Approach:

HashMap to Count Frequencies:
   - Create a `HashMap` (`mp`) to store the frequency of each character in the given string `s`.
   - Iterate through each character in the string and update its frequency in the `HashMap`.
   - Iterate through the string again and return the index of the first character with a frequency of 1.
   - If no such character is found, return -1.

Time Complexity:
   - The time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the string `s`.
   - Both iterations through the string take linear time.

Space Complexity:
   - The space complexity is O(K), where K is the number of unique characters in the string.
   - In the worst case, all characters are unique, leading to a space complexity of O(N) (considering the input string contains N characters).
